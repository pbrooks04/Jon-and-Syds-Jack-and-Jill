###Things you might want to know...

  I didn't make a formal 'Quit Game' option, so just Alt-Tab out of it.
  
  You can hold the spacebar.
  
  Each level is mostly random, higher levels are more likely to be more difficult.
  
  The executable file must run with the __Data folder in the same directory.
  If it can't find it, it won't work.
  
  The game was supposed to give better rewards for opting out at higher levels. The top scorers
  for each game were to win an additional prize.
  
  In the menu, you can press 'M' to go back to the main, similarly for 'A' & 'I' to pick a game.
  
  To extract on windows, it should be something like 'right-click', 'Extract All...', and then pick a location.
